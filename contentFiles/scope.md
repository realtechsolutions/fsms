Clause 1 defines that ISO 22000 applies to all organizations involved in the food chain, regardless of size, activity, or position in the chain.   
It can be used by companies involved in primary production, processing, manufacturing, distribution, storage, transportation, food service, catering, retail, and suppliers of packaging, equipment, cleaning agents, feed, and other food-related materials.   
The standard specifies requirements for a Food Safety Management System (FSMS) to ensure food is safe at the time of consumption, through effective control of food safety hazards.   
It is also intended to ensure compliance with statutory, regulatory, customer, and internal requirements, and supports communication across the food chain.
