For the purposes of this standard, the following terms and definitions apply.

1.  ##### Acceptable level
Level of a food safety hazard not to be exceeded in the end product provided by the organization.

2.  ##### Action criterion
Measurable or observable specification for the monitoring of an OPRP.

3.  ##### Audit
Systematic, independent and documented process to obtain audit evidence and evaluate it objectively to determine the extetent to which audit criteria are fulfilled.

4.  ##### Competence
Ability to apply knowledge and skills to achieve intended results.

5.  ##### Conformity
Fulfilment of a requirement.

6.  ##### Contamination
Introduction or occurrence of a contaminant, including a food safety hazard, in a product or  processing environment.

7.  ##### Continual improvement
Recurring activity to enhance performance.

8.  ##### Control measure
Action or activity essential to prevent a significant food safety hazard or reduce it to an acceptable level.

9.  ##### Correction
Action to eliminate a detected nonconformity.

10.  ##### Corrective action
Action to eliminate the cause of a nonconformity and prevent recurrence.

11.  ##### Critical control point (CCP)
step in the process  at which control measure(s)  is (are) applied to prevent or reduce a
significant food safety hazard  to an acceptable level, and defined critical limit(s)  and
measurement  enable the application of corrections 

12.  ##### Critical limit
Measurable value separating acceptability from unacceptability.

13.  ##### Documented information
Information required to be controlled and maintained, including the medium where it is stored.

14.  ##### Effectiveness
Extent to which planned activities and results are achieved.

15.  ##### End product
Product that undergoes no further processing by the organization.

16.  ##### Feed

fed to food-producing animals.


17.  ##### Flow diagram
Schematic representation of the sequence and interactions of process steps.

18.  ##### Food
substance (ingredient), whether processed, semi-processed or raw, which is intended for consumption,
and includes drink, chewing gum and any substance which has been used in the manufacture,
preparation or treatment of “food” but does not include cosmetics or tobacco or substances (ingredients)
used only as drugs


19.  ##### Animal food
Product intended for non-food-producing animals.

20.  ##### Food chain
Sequence of the stages in the production, processing, distribution, storage and handling of a food (3.18)
and its ingredients, from primary production to consumption


21.  ##### Food safety
Assurance that food will not cause an adverse health effect for the consumer when it is prepared and/or
consumed in accordance with its intended use


22.  ##### Food safety hazard
Biological, chemical or physical agent with potential to cause adverse health effects.

23.  ##### Interested party (stakeholder)
Person or organization (3.31) that can affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a decision

27.  ##### Monitoring
Determining the status of a system, a process or an activity.

28.  ##### Nonconformity
Non-fulfilment of a requirement.

29.  ##### Objective
Result to be achieved.

30.  ##### Operational prerequisite programme (OPRP)
Control measure or combination of control measures applied to prevent or reduce a significant food safety hazard to an acceptable level, and where action criterion and measurement or observation enable effective control of the process and/or product.

31.  ##### Organization
Person or group of people that has its own functions with responsibilities, authorities and relationships to achieve its objectives.

32.  ##### Outsource

38.  ##### Requirement
Need or expectation that is stated, generally implied or obligatory.

39.  ##### Risk
Effect of uncertainty.

40.  ##### Significant food safety hazard
Food safety hazard, identified through the hazard assessment, which needs to be controlled by control measures.

41.  ##### Top management
Person or group of people who directs and controls an organization at the highest level.

42.  ##### Traceability
Ability to follow the history, application, movement and location of an object through specified stage(s) of production, processing and distribution.
