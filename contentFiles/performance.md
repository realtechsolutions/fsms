This clause focuses on reviewing how well the Food Safety Management System is performing.   
It requires monitoring, measurement, analysis, and evaluation of food safety processes.  
Organizations must conduct internal audits, management reviews, and assess system effectiveness based on documented data, trends, and performance results to ensure continual compliance and improvement.  
Following are the points covered in the standard.  

1. ##### Monitoring, measurement, analysis and evaluation

   ***1.1 General***

   The organization shall determine:  
   a) what needs to be monitored and measured;  
   b)the methods for monitoring, measurement, analysis and evaluation, as applicable, to ensure valid results;  
   c)when the monitoring and measuring shall be performed;  
   e)who shall analyse and evaluate the results from monitoring and measurement.  
   d) when the results from monitoring and measurement shall be analysed and evaluated;  
	The organization shall retain appropriate documented information as evidence of the results.  
   The organization shall evaluate the performance and the effectiveness of the FSMS.

   ***1.2. Analysis and evaluation***

    The organization shall analyse and evaluate appropriate data and information arising from monitoring and measurement, including the results of verification activities related to PRPs and the hazard control.   
    The analysis shall be carried out:    
    a)to confirm that the overall performance of the system meets the planned arrangements and the FSMS requirements established by the organization;      
    b) to identify the need for updating or improving the FSMS;    
    c)to identify trends which indicate a higher incidence of potentially unsafe products or process failures;

    e)to provide evidence that corrections and corrective actions are effective.  
    The results of the analysis and the resulting activities shall be retained as documented information.   
    The results shall be reported to top management and used as input to the management review (see 9.3) and the updating of the FSMS (see 10.3).
