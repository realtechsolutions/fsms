    *5.2.4 Selection and categorization of control measure(s)*

    Based on the hazard assessment, the organization shall select an appropriate control  measure or combination of control measures that will be capable of preventing or reducing the identified  significant food safety hazards to defined acceptable levels.  
    The organization shall categorize the selected identified control measure(s) to be managed as OPRP(s)  or at CCPs .
    The categorization shall be carried out using a systematic approach. For each of the control measures  selected, there shall be an assessment of the following:
    a) the likelihood of failure of its functioning;
    b) the severity of the consequence in the case of failure of its functioning; this assessment shall   include:
    1) the effect on identified significant food safety hazards;
    2) the location in relation to other control measure(s);
    3) whether it is specifically established and applied to reduce the hazards to an acceptable level;
    4) whether it is a single measure or is part of combination of control measure(s).
   
    In addition, for each control measure, the systematic approach shall include an assessment of  the feasibility of:  
    
    a)establishing measurable critical limits and/or measurable/observable 
    action criteria;
    b) monitoring to detect any failure to remain within critical limit and/or measurable/observable
    c)applying timely corrections in case of failure.
   
    action criteria;
    
    The decision-making process and results of the selection and categorization of the control measures   shall be maintained as documented information.
    External requirements (e.g. statutory, regulatory and customer requirements) that can impact the  choice and the strictness of the control measures shall also be maintained as documented information.
    
    
    ***5.3 Validation of control measure(s) and combinations of control measures***
    
    The food safety team shall validate that the selected control measures are capable of achieving the intended control of the significant food safety hazard(s). This validation shall be done prior to   implementation of control measure(s) and combinations of control measures to be included in the   hazard control plan .(see 8.5.4) and after any change therein (see 7.4.2, 7.4.3, 10.2 and 10.3).     
    When the result of validation shows that the control measures(s) is (are) not capable of achieving  the intended control, the food safety team shall modify and  The food safety team shall maintain the validation methodology and evidence of capability of the   control measure(s) to achieve the intended control as documented information.
    NOTE
    Modification can include changes in control measure(s) (i.e. process parameters, rigour and/or their   combination) and/or change(s) in the manufacturing technologies for raw materials, end product characteristics,
    methods of distribution and intended use of the end products.
    
    ***5.4 Hazard control plan (HACCP/OPRP plan)***
    
    *5.4.1 General*

    Critical limits at CCPs shall be measurable. Conformance with critical limits shall ensure that the acceptable level is not exceeded.  
    Action criteria for OPRPs shall be measurable or observable. Conformance with action criteria shall contribute to the assurance that the acceptable level is not exceeded.   

    *5.4.3 Monitoring systems at CCPs and for OPRPs*

    At each CCP, a monitoring system shall be established for each control measure or combination of control measure(s) to detect any failure to remain within the critical limits.   
    The system shall include all  scheduled measurements relative to the critical limit(s).  
    For each OPRP, a monitoring system shall be established for the control measure or combination of control measure(s) to detect failure to meet the action criterion.
